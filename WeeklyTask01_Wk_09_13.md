# Working with Text in Markdown
### Quote of the Week
*"It always seems impossible until it's done"*

## Thoughts on the Assignment

1. Issues

It took sometime figuring out how to create a pull request. It was also difficult to know where to write a Markdown. At first I thought I needed to create a file with a .md extension. I utilized some "Help" documents on GitHub to assist with Markdown formatting.

After getting adjusted to the space, I made some edits to the final name, comments, etc.

I wasn't sure if it this task should be a separate file or part of the pull request -- I did both.

2. Helpful Resource

I found this link on GitHub helpful [link to GitHub MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

3. Questions
* Is there a good directory of Markdown formatting guides?
* How does Markdown interact with other coding or is it just styling?
